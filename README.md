# Decentralized Scientific Research Funding DAO

## Project Overview

A blockchain-powered platform democratizing scientific research funding through transparent, community-driven mechanisms that empower researchers and eliminate traditional funding barriers.

## Core Features

### 1. Research Proposal Ecosystem
- Permissionless research proposal submissions
- Blockchain-based peer review process
- Anonymous and transparent evaluation mechanisms
- Comprehensive proposal metadata tracking

### 2. Tokenized Governance Model
- Research funding tokens (RFT) for community voting
- Weighted voting based on expertise and contribution history
- Quadratic voting mechanisms to prevent centralization
- Token-based reputation system

### 3. Smart Contract Funding Mechanism
- Milestone-driven fund allocation
- Escrow-based fund management
- Automated progress verification
- Transparent fund tracking

### 4. Academic Result Verification
- Integration with academic publishing platforms
- Cryptographic proof of research outputs
- Open-access publication incentives
- Verifiable research impact metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- Ethereum-compatible smart contract ecosystem
- Layer 2 scaling solutions for cost efficiency
- Modular contract design for upgradability

### Governance Contracts
- Proposal submission contract
- Voting and allocation contracts
- Milestone verification contract
- Reputation management contract

### Identity and Credentials
- Decentralized identity (DID) integration
- Verifiable credentials for researchers
- Academic achievement tokenization

### Oracle Integrations
- Academic database oracles
- Publication verification services
- Research impact measurement

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Hardhat
- Truffle
- Web3.js
- IPFS
- MetaMask

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/research-dao/scientific-funding-platform.git
cd scientific-funding-platform
```

2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile Contracts

npx hardhat compile
```

4. Run Local Blockchain
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

5. Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Governance Mechanisms

### Proposal Lifecycle
1. Submission
2. Initial Screening
3. Peer Review
4. Community Voting
5. Funding Allocation
6. Milestone Tracking
7. Result Verification

### Voting Parameters
- Minimum token threshold for voting
- Expertise-weighted voting power
- Quadratic voting calculation
- Transparent vote tallying

## Security Measures

- Comprehensive smart contract audits
- Multi-signature governance wallets
- Upgrade mechanisms with time-locks
- Formal verification of critical contracts
- Bug bounty program

## Research Domains

- Open to all scientific disciplines
- Prioritization of:
    - High-impact research
    - Interdisciplinary projects
    - Underrepresented research areas

## Tokenomics

- Research Funding Token (RFT)
- Initial Distribution:
    - Founding researchers: 20%
    - Community pool: 50%
    - Development team: 15%
    - Reserve: 15%
- Dynamic token model with inflation control

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial contract development
- [ ] Testnet deployment
- [ ] Academic partnerships
- [ ] Multi-chain expansion
- [ ] Machine learning impact prediction
- [ ] Global research marketplace

## Community Participation

- Discord community
